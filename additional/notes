1) HTTP-HEAD not supported on big catalog?  Easier to cache the catalog if can HTTP-head it?
   Trying an HTTP GET without fetching body is still slow & blocking.

2) API doesn't really document date format (it's seconds from epoch)

3) duplicates in your catalog?

42 duplicates, all with same netflixId

4) Your versioning plan is wrong.

Use of the version parameter is optional. If not specified in a request,
then by default the most recent, stable version of the API is used.
At this time, the API only supports a version value of 1.0.

This means that old clients that have no clue about versioning (or using the default) will suddenly break when v2
comes out.  Make it by default use 1.0 if not specified, or version another way.
